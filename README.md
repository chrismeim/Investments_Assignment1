# Investments_Assignment1

The scope of this project is to test the use of the CAPM and the 3 factor model, by using some date from 10 different portfolios and comparing them with 3 factors (Rm, SMB, HML)

The first step includes a time-series regression to calculate factor loadings or
betas for each of the 10 portfolios given.

The second step involves a a cross-sectional regression of returns on loadings from the 10 portfolios, calculating the risk premium for each variable.

The file data.xls provides excess returns on three factors (mkt, smb, hml - columns BD) which are in excess return form as well as the risk-less rate (column E), from 1990-
2002. Columns F-O provide returns on 10 portfolios (which are not in excess return).
The file mpr.xls provides excess return information for the 10 portfolios for 2003.
